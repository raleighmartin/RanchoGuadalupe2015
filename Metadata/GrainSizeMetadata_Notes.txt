Discrepancy in times for surface samples on 3/23/2015.  Field notes say that samples were collected at the following times:
BSNE A: 14:46
BSNE B: 14:46
BSNE C: 14:47
Wenglor: 18:43

But original filenames generated by Camsizer under Francis instruction were (perhaps from labels on baggies):
BSNE A: 14:45
BSNE B: 14:45
BSNE C: 14:47
Wenglor: 14:40

Since the original sample times (in the spreadsheet) align with the timestamps of grain size photos, we will assume that these times are correct.  Renaming the Camsizer output filenames accordingly.
